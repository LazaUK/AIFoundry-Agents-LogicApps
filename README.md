## Part 1: Configuring the Environment
To run the provided Jupyter notebooks, you'll need to set up your Azure AI Foundry environment and install the required Python packages.

### 1.1 Prerequisites
You need an **Azure AI Foundry** project with a model deployment that supports function calling (e.g., GPT-4.1-mini). You also need a pre-existing Azure Logic App with an **HTTP Trigger** configured to accept incoming requests.

### 1.2 Authentication
The demo uses **Microsoft Entra ID** authentication via `DefaultAzureCredential` from the `azure.identity` package. To enable this, ensure you are authenticated through the Azure CLI (`az login`), by setting up environment variables for a service principal, or by using a managed identity in an Azure environment.

### 1.3 Environment Variables
Configure the following environment variables with your Azure credentials and project details:

| Environment Variable             | Description                                               |
| :------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AZURE_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` | The endpoint URL for your Azure AI Foundry project.       |
| `AZURE_FOUNDRY_GPT_MODEL`        | The name of your model deployment.                        |
| `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`          | Your Azure subscription ID.                               |
| `RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME`            | The name of the resource group containing your Logic App. |

### 1.4 Required Libraries
Install the necessary Python packages using pip:
``` bash
pip install azure-identity azure-ai-projects azure-ai-agents azure-mgmt-logic requests
```
