## Part 1: Configuring the Environment
To run the provided Jupyter notebooks, you'll need to set up your Azure AI Foundry environment and install the required Python packages.

### 1.1 Prerequisites
You need an **Azure AI Foundry** project with a model deployment that supports function calling (e.g., GPT-4.1-mini). You also need a pre-existing Azure Logic App with an **HTTP Trigger** configured to accept incoming requests.

### 1.2 Authentication
The demo uses **Microsoft Entra ID** authentication via `DefaultAzureCredential` from the `azure.identity` package. To enable this, ensure you are authenticated through the Azure CLI (`az login`), by setting up environment variables for a service principal, or by using a managed identity in an Azure environment.

### 1.3 Environment Variables
Configure the following environment variables with your Azure credentials and project details:

| Environment Variable             | Description                                               |
| :------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AZURE_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` | The endpoint URL for your Azure AI Foundry project.       |
| `AZURE_FOUNDRY_GPT_MODEL`        | The name of your model deployment.                        |
| `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`          | Your Azure subscription ID.                               |
| `RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME`            | The name of the resource group containing your Logic App. |
| `LOGIC_APP_NAME`                 | The name of the Azure Logic App resource                  |
| `TRIGGER_NAME`                   | The name of the Logic App's HTTP trigger node             |

### 1.4 Required Libraries
Install the necessary Python packages using pip:

``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Part 2: Configuring Logic App as a Tool using Function Calling
This section details how to wrap a Logic App's functionality within a Python function and expose it to the AI agent as a tool.

### 2.1 The `AzureLogicAppTool` Class
A dedicated class, `AzureLogicAppTool`, is used to manage the Logic App. It performs two key tasks:
* `register_logic_app`: This method retrieves the unique callback URL for the Logic App's HTTP-Trigger. It uses the `LogicManagementClient` to securely obtain this URL, which is required to invoke the Logic App.
* `invoke_logic_app`: This method sends a `POST` request to the registered callback URL with a JSON payload, effectively triggering the Logic App workflow.

``` Python
class AzureLogicAppTool:
    """
    A service that manages Logic Apps by retrieving their callback URLs and invoking them.
    """

    def __init__(self, subscription_id: str, resource_group: str, credential=None):
        if credential is None:
            credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
        self.subscription_id = subscription_id
        self.resource_group = resource_group
        self.logic_client = LogicManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
        self.callback_urls: Dict[str, str] = {}

    def register_logic_app(self, logic_app_name: str, trigger_name: str) -> None:
        """
        Retrieves and stores a callback URL for a specific Logic App + trigger.
        """
        <...>

    def invoke_logic_app(self, logic_app_name: str, payload: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """
        Invokes the registered Logic App with the given JSON payload.
        """
        <...>
```

### 2.2 Python Wrapper Function
A helper function, `create_weather_forecast_function`, acts as a bridge between the AI agent and the `AzureLogicAppTool`:
* Accepting a `location` parameter from the agent.
* Constructing the necessary JSON `payload`.
* Calling the `invoke_logic_app` method from the `AzureLogicAppTool` class.
* Formating the result into a standardized JSON response that the agent can easily parse.

``` Python
def create_weather_forecast_function(logic_app_tool: AzureLogicAppTool, logic_app_name: str) -> Callable[[str], str]:
    """
    Creates a weather forecast function that can be used by the AI agent.
    """
    
    def get_weather_forecast(location: str) -> str:
        """
        Gets weather forecast for a specific location using the Logic App.
        
        :param location: The location to get weather forecast for (e.g., "London", "New York", "Tokyo")
        :return: A JSON string containing the weather forecast information
        """
        payload = {"Location": location}
        
        try:
            result = logic_app_tool.invoke_logic_app(logic_app_name, payload)
            
            if result.get("result") == "success":
                weather_info = result.get("weather_data", result.get("data", "Weather data received"))
                return json.dumps({
                    "status": "success",
                    "location": location,
                    "forecast": weather_info
                })
            else:
                return json.dumps({
                    "status": "error",
                    "location": location,
                    "error": result.get("error", "Unknown error occurred")
                })
                
        except Exception as e:
            return json.dumps({
                "status": "error",
                "location": location,
                "error": str(e)
            })
    
    return get_weather_forecast
```

### 2.3 Agent Configuration
With the Python wrapper function defined, you can now configure the AI agent:
1.  **Define Agent Tools**: The `get_weather_forecast` function is added to a `FunctionTool` instance. A separate `get_current_datetime` function is also included to demonstrate the agent's ability to use multiple tools.
2.  **Enable Function Calling**: The `agents_client.enable_auto_function_calls()` method is used to instruct the agent's model to automatically call the defined tools when appropriate.
3.  **Create the Agent**: An agent is created with a clear instruction set that guides it to use the `get_weather_forecast` tool when asked about the weather.

The output of AI agent's setup may look like this:

``` JSON
Setting up agent tools...
Creating weather agent...
Created weather agent with ID: asst_P24uYTY3zZhH2VFnP6on62lt
Creating conversation thread...
Created thread with ID: thread_au3fmRys3MadIZTnCppkDHmf
Agent is ready! You can now interact with it.
```

## Part 3: Configuring Logic App as a Tool using OpenAPI Schema with SAS Token auth
This section demonstrates how to integrate Azure Logic Apps with Azure AI Foundry agents using **OpenAPI schema**.

### 3.1 The `LogicAppsIntegration` Class
The `LogicAppsIntegration` class manages the integration between Logic Apps and the AI agent through OpenAPI spec. It handles:

* Callback URL Retrieval
* OpenAPI Spec Generation
* Tool Creation

``` Python
class LogicAppsIntegration:
    """
    This class uses Logic Apps callback URL as-is and creates OpenAPI tools.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, subscription_id: str, resource_group: str, credential=None):
        if credential is None:
            credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
        
        self.subscription_id = subscription_id
        self.resource_group = resource_group
        self.credential = credential
        self.logic_client = LogicManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
    
    def get_callback_url(self, logic_app_name: str, trigger_name: str) -> str:
        """Get the actual callback URL from Logic App."""
        # Implementation retrieves secure callback URL
        
    def create_direct_openapi_spec(self, callback_url: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Create a minimal OpenAPI 3.0 spec that uses the callback URL directly."""
        # Implementation creates OpenAPI specification
        
    def create_openapi_tool(self, logic_app_name: str, trigger_name: str) -> OpenApiTool:
        """Create OpenAPI tool using direct callback URL approach."""
        # Implementation returns configured OpenApiTool
```

### 3.2 OpenAPI Specification Generation
The class automatically generates a minimal OpenAPI 3.0 spec that includes:

* Server Configuration
* Authentication
* JSON payload structure

``` Python
openapi_spec = {
    "openapi": "3.0.0",
    "info": {
        "title": "Logic App Weather API",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "description": "Direct access to Logic App via callback URL"
    },
    "servers": [{"url": callback_url.split('?')[0]}],
    "paths": {
        "/": {
            "post": {
                "operationId": "get_weather",
                "summary": "Get weather information",
                "requestBody": {
                    "required": True,
                    "content": {
                        "application/json": {
                            "schema": {
                                "type": "object",
                                "properties": {
                                    "Location": {
                                        "type": "string",
                                        "description": "The location to get weather for"
                                    }
                                },
                                "required": ["Location"]
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 3.3 Agent Setup with OpenAPI Tools
The OpenAPI approach simplifies agent configuration by providing a standardised tool definition:

``` Python
# Initialize Logic App integration
logic_integration = LogicAppsIntegration(
    subscription_id=SUBSCRIPTION_ID,
    resource_group=RESOURCE_GROUP
)

# Create OpenAPI tool
openapi_tool, tool_name = logic_integration.create_openapi_tool(
    logic_app_name=LOGIC_APP_NAME,
    trigger_name=TRIGGER_NAME,
    tool_name="get_weather",
    tool_description="Get weather forecast for any location"
)

# Create AI Agent with OpenAPI tool
agent = agents_client.create_agent(
    model=MODEL_DEPLOYMENT,
    name="weather-agent",
    instructions="You are a helpful weather assistant. When asked about weather, use the get_weather tool with the location provided by the user.",
    tools=openapi_tool.definitions,
)
```

### 3.4 Usage Example
Once configured, the agent can seamlessly use the Logic App tool:

``` Python
# Create a conversation thread
thread = agents_client.threads.create()

# Send a message requesting weather information
message = agents_client.messages.create(
    thread_id=thread.id,
    role="user",
    content="What's the weather in London?",
)

# Process the request (agent will automatically call the Logic App)
run = agents_client.runs.create_and_process(
    thread_id=thread.id,
    agent_id=agent.id
)
```

The agent will use the OpenAPI tool to call the Logic App and provide a formatted response to the user, similar to this:

``` JSON
Displaying conversation results...
Found 2 messages
--------------------------------------------------
User: What's the weather in London?
--------------------------------------------------
Assistant: The weather in London is currently cloudy. During the day, the high temperature will be 19Â°C with wind speeds around 22 km/h coming from the southwest (217Â°). At night, it will remain cloudy with a low temperature of 17Â°C and winds around 20 km/h from the south-southwest (202Â°). The skies are overcast, and there is a chance of light rain. Ultraviolet (UV) levels are low.
--------------------------------------------------
```

> [!NOTE]
> The OpenAPI approach provides better standardisation, automatic validation and reduced maintenance while enabling full functionality of Logic Apps integration.

## Part 4: Configuring Logic App as a Tool using OpenAPI Schema with Managed Identity auth

<<WORK IN PROGRESS>>

## Appendix: Sample Logic App
To demonstrate the integration, you'll need a Logic App with an HTTP trigger that accepts location parameter and returns weather information.
